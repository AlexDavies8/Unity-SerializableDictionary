# SerializableDictionary
A serializable dictionary class for Unity.

Unity cannot serialize standard dictionaries. This means that they won't show or be edited in the inspector
and they won't be instantiated at startup. A classic workaround is to store the keys and values in separate arrays
and construct the dictionary at startup.

This project provides a generic dictionary class and its custom property drawer that solves this problem.
